Beneath the sun on fields so wide,
The game of cricket stirs with pride.
Willow meets leather, echoing loud,
As cheers erupt from every crowd.

The bowler runs with fierce intent,
Each ball a tale, each seam well bent.
The batter waits with focused eye,
To strike or duck as fate draws nigh.

Fielders dive on grassy plains,
For every run, the team campaigns.
The umpire’s hand, so calm and wise,
Can silence hope or let it rise.

In whites or blues, they chase the dream,
Of glory born in sweat and team.
For cricket’s more than bat and ball—
It’s heart and soul, the game of all.
