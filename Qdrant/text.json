    "through what's now become a\nweekly snow disaster.\nThis week's maybe three\nof them or something.",
    "My name's John Gabrieli.\nThis is Introductory to\nPsychology, 9.00.\nThis is a course about you.",
    "The entire course is what do we\nunderstand in a scientific\nway about human nature--",
    "how people's minds work, how\npeople's brains work that\nsupports their mind.",
    "This entire course is about\nwhat's a scientific way to\nunderstanding how people feel,",
    "think, and act in the world.\nAnd so we're trying to say that\nwe constantly think you",
    "must in your everyday life think\nabout why do you have\nyour preferences,\nyour desires?",
    "your desires?\nWhat's easy for you?\nWhat's hard for you?\nWhat's delightful for you?",
    "Why do other people behave\nthe way they do?\nHow do they think?\nHow do they feel?",
    "And so there's a lot of realms\nof this that are tough to get\nto by science.",
    "to by science.\nBut what we're going to focus on\nthis semester is where the",
    "scientific approach has shed\nlight in the way that we used\nto think about experiments\nand evidence,",
    "and evidence,\nabout how humans tick.\nAnd as we go through this\nsemester, we'll talk about the",
    "brain, we'll talk a fair bit\nabout chapters from this book,\nThe Man Who Mistook His Wife for",
    "a Hat, from Oliver Sacks.\nIt was a bestseller even when it\nwasn't [? a ScienceWare ?]\ncourse.",
    "course.\nIt's a great book.\nYou'll enjoy it.\nShort, really fun chapters.",
    "We'll talk about how we perceive\nthe world; how we\nsee; especially, a little bit,",
    "how we hear; how we think; how\nwe feel; personality; how we\ndiffer from one to the other;",
    "and what we're sort of like;\nand how we behave in the\nworld; development from",
    "childhood and infancy through\nadolescence, through young\nadulthood, where you are",
    "mostly, through getting older,\nwhere I am; social\ninteraction, how we behave in",
    "groups and think about other\npeople; and variation in\nthe mental health or\npsychopathology.",
    "And increasingly, we understand\nthat there's a huge\nnumber of people who, at some",
    "moment in their life or\nanother, struggle with some\naspect of mental health.",
    "And then we'll focus a lot on,\nnot only the psychological\naspects of what we study in",
    "terms of behavior, but also\nthe brain basis of that, and\nthink a little bit about to",
    "what extent the mind is what the\nbrain does, to what extent\nthe mind is what\nthe brain does.",
    "And so for every dimension of\nbeing a human being that we'll\ntalk about, we'll also talk",
    "about what we understand\ncurrently from the\nneurological and\nneuroscientific literature",
    "about how the human brain\nsupports and contributes\nto different\naspects of being a person.\nOK.",
    "OK.\nSo everybody who works in a\ncertain field thinks that\ntheir field is really, really,",
    "really special, right?\nSo here's why psychology\nis really,\nreally, really special.",
    "So it's really, really special,\nI think, most of all,\nbecause every endeavor that we",
    "undertake at a university or\nin society as a whole--\nit's about people, right, except",
    "for when we think about\nthe rest of nature.\nBut people study biology,\nchemistry, and physics.",
    "And they think, right, that the\nsun orbits the earth for\nsome period of time.\nAnd then they think",
    "it's the other way\naround currently, right?\nOK, so people come up with\nthese conclusions.",
    "Even though we're trying to\nunderstand nature, it's people\nwho make certain investments",
    "in economics or behave in a\ncertain way or vote\nin a certain way.\nIt's people who make music and",
    "appreciate music, make art and\nappreciate art, read and write\nliterature, right?",
    "So in all these dimensions,\nthere's something very\nfundamental about what it is",
    "about the human mind that\ngives birth to these areas of\ninquiry and how those areas,",
    "domains of human experience,\nare enacted.\nSo my only goal today is to\ntry to convince you in a",
    "number of different ways that\nwe're not simple video camera\nin our minds between our ears,",
    "recording the world in some\nobjective, simple way, that\neven the simplest, most\nobvious things are",
    "interpretations of the world\naround us at many different\nlevels of thought and feeling",
    "and perception.\nAnd then our minds, the way\nour minds are constructed,\ndetermines the world that we",
    "experience, that we see, that\nwe act upon.\nAnd even very simple things\nthat we think are pretty",
    "objective and simple, right\nin front of our eyes, are\ndetermined by inferences and",
    "deductions that our mind\nmakes, weighing sources of\nevidence in the world and",
    "coming to conclusions about\nwhat's around us, what we\nhear, what we see,\nand how we think.",
    "So let's start with seeing.\nIf your vision is reasonable,\nwe say we see something, we",
    "believe it, right?\nSo let's start with something\nvery simple--\nthese lines.",
    "these lines.\nSo one of the tough things about\npsychology is ever since\nthe Internet came into",
    "existence, people know every\ncool thing there is\nto know, right?\nOK.\nI can tell you when I began",
    "teaching, people said, oh my\ngosh, I've never seen\nsuch a thing.\nIt's unbelievable!",
    "And then now, it's like two\nthirds of the class is like,\nyeah, I've got that on",
    "my computer at home.\nWe did that in third\ngrade or whatever.\nSo all I'm saying is enjoy the",
    "ones you haven't seen before,\ndon't ruin it for your neighbors\ntoday, because it's",
    "harder and harder to\nsurprise the world\nin a nice way, right?\nOK, but let's look at these",
    "lines for a moment here.\nAnd perhaps you'll have the\nsense, and maybe-- is it",
    "glaring up there, sir?\nLet's see.\nOK, is that better?\nOK.\nMaybe not.",
    "OK.\nMaybe not.\nSo you might have the sense that\nthis line is a different\nlength than this line.",
    "And this might be somewhere\nintermediate, right?\nNow you know, because of",
    "psychology, it's all a trick.\nBut what's simpler than\nthe length of a line?\nWhat's more objective",
    "in some sense than\nthe length of a line?\nBut if we look at the actual\nlengths, they're",
    "all literally identical.\nBut that center part\nlooks different.\nSo what does it mean for",
    "it to look different?\nIt means our minds are\ndetermining as simple a thing",
    "as how long a line is depending\non the other\ninformation surrounding it.\nIt's an interpretation",
    "in context.\nIf we're simply looking, the\nlines will look the same.\nLet's try another one.",
    "It's remarkable that those two\nlines are identical in length.\n[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: OK, all right.",
    "It's OK to test the limits\nof the credibility of the\naudience, right?\nAll right.\nYeah.",
    "Yeah.\nOf course, if our visual system\nwere ludicrously off,\nwe'd be constantly walking into",
    "walls and falling out\nwindows and things like that,\nright, if we were\nmisestimating at that length.",
    "So the idea where we have visual\nillusions-- and I'll\nshow you some more that I think",
    "you'll be impressed by--\nit's not that our visual system\nis messed up or that",
    "psychologists think it's\nhilarious to trick us.\nIt's that lots of things our",
    "visual system is a brilliant\nat, but it's brilliant by\nhaving certain laws or",
    "principles that it follows.\nAnd we can show this following\nthose principles by seeing",
    "that when we mess with the\ntypical circumstances, those\nprinciples calculate\nthe wrong answer.",
    "So here's another one.\nSo, to most people, which line\nlooks bigger, the one in the",
    "middle or the one on the side?\nI know you know it's\nall a trick, right?\nOK.",
    "OK.\nWhat could be more obvious\nthan that this is longer?\nIt's just a simple line, but if",
    "we draw red lines on top of\nit then move them over here,\nthey're dead identical.",
    "The central circle--\ndoes one of them, the\nmiddle circle, look\nlarger than the other?",
    "Now you already know,\nintellectually, that it will\nturn out those two circles in",
    "the middle will be the same.\nBut you have to convince\nyourself that it still looks",
    "like they're different.\nHere there in red.\nHere they are next\nto each other.\nThey're identical.",
    "Again, this is evidence that,\neven for a simple thing like\nthe size of a circle, your mind",
    "is making inferences.\nAnd there are principles and\nlaws that it's following that",
    "determine what it is you\nthink that you see.\nHere is two monsters\nchasing each other.",
    "But in fact, they're\nidentical in size.\nThe perspective cues make\nthe more distant",
    "one look much bigger.\nThis is from Ted Adelson.\nThis is a beautiful\ndemonstration of an illusion.",
    "Ted Adelson's in the psychology\ndepartment.\nThere's a letter A here.\nAnd believe it or not, there's",
    "a letter B there.\nLet's see if this looks any\nbetter when it goes like this.\nIt doesn't.\nAll right.",
    "All right.\nSo one of the important things\nabout illusions,\ndemonstrations in this class--",
    "and you will learn this as we\ngo along-- is occasionally they\nfail, and we come back",
    "and discover what the\nlesson of that is.\nSo I'm just telling you\nit's showing you on my",
    "monitor much brighter.\nIt always has before.\nWe'll adjust that.\nSo I'm going to skip this, but",
    "I'll show you another time,\nbecause it's so good.\nAnd I'm going to feel\nbad about this.\nOK.",
    "OK.\nNow, let's see.\nThis'll work.\nAll the same shade\nof grey, right?\n[LAUGHTER]",
    "[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: Did that work\nreasonably from where you sat?\nWe'll try a few more.\nMaybe.",
    "Maybe.\nFor some reason,\nmy connection's\nalways like this, sorry.\nDoes that one look lighter",
    "than that one that way?\nYeah.\nNow they look radically\ndifferent, right?",
    "It's the same grey constantly.\nBut again, the context is hugely\ndetermining how to",
    "bright you see that grey.\nThere it is.\nTwo boxes equal grey.\nSo things as simple as how",
    "bright something is or how\nlong something is depend\non interpretation.\nHere's an illusion from",
    "Roger Shepard.\nIt's kind of great.\nSo here's two kind of different\nlooking tables, right?",
    "But they're not that\ndifferent.\nAnd watch.\nThere goes one tabletop.\nYou're not impressed that those",
    "are identical tables?\nOK.\nWant me to do it again?\nThat's the identical tabletop.",
    "To me, the one on the left looks\npretty rectangular and\nthe one on the right looks",
    "pretty square-ish.\nYou're not easy to\nimpress, are you?\n[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: You see that those",
    "two bars are moving together\nat the same time.\nDoes it look like they're\nlittle steps?",
    "little steps?\nIt'll show you.\nAll right, fine.\nIt's just like that, but\nnow you add those bars.",
    "Does it look like little steps?\n[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: One more\nof this kind.\nThis is kind of fun.",
    "You see the way that the\nmask is turning?\nIt always looks like it's\ntowards you, even though I'm--",
    "one of the rotations-- it's\nbecause of the way you're\ninterpreting the light is\ninfluencing how you",
    "interpreting what's--\nOK.\nSo that's simply a consequence,\nas far as people",
    "understand that, that the source\nof the illumination is\nnot where you're used to, so",
    "you're misinterpreting where\nthe illumination is coming\nfrom for the depth of the",
    "face, what's front and what's\nback, whether the nose is\nsticking in or sticking out.\nOK.",
    "OK.\nSo again, the point in these\nillusions is, even for very\nsimple things our, minds make",
    "certain assumptions about how\nwe interpret the world.\nAnd that drives everything that",
    "we see and how we act\nupon what we see.\nSo at a slightly higher\nor more conceptual",
    "level, I need your help.\nNow, there's lots of these\nthings we'll do this semester",
    "where you get to participate.\nThe fun thing about--\nI said this course was about",
    "you-- when you could have\nthought that was a bit\nrhetorical, it's not.\nIt's truly about you.",
    "So you get to be your\nown laboratory.\nWe get to share a laboratory\nsitting here.",
    "sitting here.\nAnd what I'm going to do is ask\nfor you to participate.\nYou don't have to do any of",
    "these things sitting at your\nseat, but I think it's usually\nfun to do them.",
    "So what's going to happen\nis I'm going\nto show you a drawing.\nIf the people to my left--",
    "so about in the middle, but you\ncan decide for yourself--\nabout this way, let's have you",
    "be Group A if you're willing\nto be that way.\nAll right.\nBecause of that, I\ncan't call you--",
    "I was going to call you guys\nGroup B, but I already see\nthat's getting me in trouble.",
    "So we'll call it Group B, but\nthat really means equals A.\nBut I'll just call it B, OK?",
    "So A and B, OK?\nSo what I need is Group B--\nB for best, A for awesome, OK.\n[LAUGHTER]",
    "[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: --Group B to close\nyour eyes for a moment.\nGroup B, if you want to have fun",
    "with this, close your eyes\nfor a moment.\nGroup A, you're gonna see some\ninstructions, and read them",
    "silently to yourself.\nAnd then I'll ask you a question\nabout the picture.\nOK, Group A, you're",
    "now reading.\nGroup B has your eyes closed.\nSo read the instructions\nsilently to yourself.\nOK?",
    "OK?\nNow Group A, close your eyes.\nEverybody has their eyes\nclosed for a moment.\nEverybody has their",
    "eyes closed.\nNow Group B, look at\nyour instructions.\nSo A has their eyes closed,",
    "B is reading instructions.\nOK?\nEverybody's eyes are open now.\nEverybody's eyes are open.",
    "Here's your picture.\nTake it in and I'm going\nto ask you a few\nquestions about it.",
    "Look at it for a moment\nand inspect it.\nOK, here we go, ready?\nSo just out loud--",
    "was there an automobile\nin the picture?\nAUDIENCE: No.\nPROFESSOR: OK.\nSee, this is a smart class.",
    "We're gonna have a--\nWas there a man in\nthe picture?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nPROFESSOR: Was there a",
    "woman in the picture?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nAUDIENCE: No.\nPROFESSOR: OK.\nThis side again, woman",
    "in the picture?\nAUDIENCE: No.\nPROFESSOR: All right,\nall right.\nOK, a child?\nAUDIENCE: No.",
    "AUDIENCE: No.\nPROFESSOR: An animal?\nAUDIENCE: No.\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nPROFESSOR: Ah.\nOK.",
    "OK.\nAnd now it gets a little wild.\nOK?\nA whip?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nPROFESSOR: OK.\nA sword?",
    "A sword?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nPROFESSOR: All right,\na man's hat?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nPROFESSOR: A ball?",
    "AUDIENCE: Yes.\nAUDIENCE: No.\nPROFESSOR: A fish?\nAUDIENCE: Yes.\nPROFESSOR: All right, so",
    "there's disagreement.\nAnd that's--\nwe're a democracy, right?\nSo all these things are",
    "big setups, right?\nSo here's what happened.\nGroup A was told they were gonna\nlook at a picture of a",
    "trained seal act.\nAnd Group B got the identical\ninstructions, but they were\ntold you're gonna look",
    "at a costume ball.\nSo you had an expectation of\nwhat you were going to see.",
    "That expectation drives your\ninterpretation of the very\nthing you see next, which\nis this picture.",
    "OK?\n[LAUGHTER]\n[CHATTER]\nPROFESSOR: OK, is\nthat all right?\nAll right.\nAnd this is just",
    "for fun, right?\nIt's a set up.\nYou're participating nicely.\nBut in the world, when groups",
    "that are arguing with each\nother about things like peace\nsettlements, read a document,",
    "or make a statement, how much\ndo you think the perspective\nthey start with guides the",
    "interpretation of what they\nread or what they hear?\nBecause you didn't have\nbig stakes in this.",
    "You weren't going, I believe in\nfish and if I don't see a\nfish, I know things aren't just",
    "and my group will be not\ntreated fairly.\nYou're not emotionally invested\nin, probably, whether",
    "there was a fish present.\nSo your interpretation, your\nbeliefs guide tremendously",
    "what you think you see and how\nyou interpret the situation--\nfor complicated things",
    "or even easy things\nlike lines or squares.\nAnd here's another kind of an\nexample where you would",
    "interpret that as a\nB for \"baker\" or\n13 if it's in numbers.\nAgain, the context is driving",
    "a lot of the interpretation.\nOK.\nNow this is one of those\nexamples that, again, when--",
    "some number of years ago,\nit was a huge hit.\nAnd now, mostly people say,\ncan't you come up with",
    "something better\nthat we haven't\nall seen on the internet?\nSo if you know this, don't",
    "ruin it for the other\nindividuals.\nBut what I need is a\nfew volunteers--\nyou'll be facing me",
    "this way-- who are\nwilling to count something.\nAnd it's MIT, we're pretty\ngood at counting.",
    "So what's the message of that?\nThe message is--\nwe've talked about what we\nperceive, what we see by",
    "expectations in context.\nBut it's also we have very\nlimited what psychologists",
    "call attentional resources.\nWe can pay attention\nto a limited number\nof things at a time.",
    "And even when those things can\nbe right in front of us, if\nour attention is focused or",
    "occupied by something else,\nlike counting the passes\nin a difficult scene--",
    "it wouldn't work if there was\none or two passes only,\nbecause you would notice it.",
    "But when your mind is focused on\nidentifying all the passes\namong the players-- and the",
    "white shirts are moving,\nthey're weaving with the other\nplayers and so on--",
    "then your attention is absorbed\nby that, and some of\nit is not left over to notice",
    "what's right in front of you.\nAnd we'll talk more\nabout that.\nBut it's a huge thing with",
    "humans that we can pay\nattention pretty well, on\naverage, to a thing at a time",
    "under many circumstances.\nAnd the other things escape us\ncompletely, even if they're",
    "obviously present if we were\nlooking at them or paying\nattention to them.",
    "So here's another example of how\nour minds make our world--\nwhat we see and what we don't",
    "see, what we pay attention to\nand what we don't pay\nattention to.\nAnd that's something to",
    "do with how we hear.\nOK, so I'm going\nto replay this.\nSo listen to what the\nguy is saying.",
    "guy is saying.\nTake a look, and\njust tell he--\nhe's saying some letters,\nOK, just not a word.",
    "What is it?\nOK, most people think he's\nsaying \"da.\" \"Da da, da da, da",
    "da.\" Now let's try that again.\nI'm going to turn off the\nsound and I'm going to\nrun the same film.",
    "What does his mouth look\nlike it's saying?\n\"Ga ga.\" OK?\nBut now we'll do one more thing,",
    "which is turn the sound\nback on, have you close\nyour eyes, and listen\nto what he's saying.",
    "What's he saying?\nAUDIENCE: \"Ba.\"\nPROFESSOR: Yeah.\nSo it doesn't work for\neverybody every time.",
    "But the basic idea is most\npeople think they hear the\nword \"da\" coming from\nthe speaker.",
    "the speaker.\nAnd in fact, in their mind they\ndo because that's how\nthey interpret what",
    "they're hearing.\nBut in reality, the film clip\nis a film clip of the person",
    "saying \"ba ba ba.\" And then an\naudio recording of the person\nsaying \"ga ga ga.\" Your mind",
    "intertwines across modalities\nwhat you hear and what you see,\nintegrates them in some",
    "way below your level\nof consciousness.\nYou're not thinking about it.",
    "And you come up with a different\ninterpretation of\nwhat you hear.\nRight?\nSo what you see would",
    "be this one thing.\nWhat you hear is\nanother thing.\nWhen your eyes are open and your",
    "ears are open, they meld\ntogether and produce\nsomething--\na third thing that's\nentirely different.",
    "Again, your mind interpreted\nwhat you hear, not your ear\ninterpreting what you hear,",
    "in a simple sense.\nOK.\nHow about things that we know?\nSo let's think about this.",
    "If somebody were to ask you\nwhich is farther east, closer\nto the Atlantic--\nSan Diego, California,",
    "or Reno, Nevada?\nWho likes San Diego as\nbeing farther east?\nA few hands.\nWho likes Reno as being",
    "farther east?\nOK.\nSo, here's the mental map most\npeople have-- the mental map--",
    "which is we know California's\nright next to the ocean with\nArnold Schwarzenegger protecting",
    "us on that side of\nthe country, right?\nAnd then Nevada's a little bit\nmore towards Boston, right?",
    "OK.\nThat's a mental map that\nmost people have.\nAnd that's how the\nhands went up.",
    "hands went up.\nThis is the actual map.\nAnd the only actual map you've\never seen, ever-- on a globe,",
    "on a map, anything.\nBecause California takes a big\nturn on the south, San Diego's",
    "further east than Reno.\nWhy do we imagine, and most\npeople do, that Reno is",
    "further east, when you've never\nseen a map or globe\nthat's shown you that?\nNever ever, ever.\nYeah.",
    "Yeah.\nPROFESSOR: Because it's farther\nfrom the ocean,\nbecause in our mind we go,",
    "California's way out there.\nThere's nothing--\nHawaii is the only one out there\nfurther west, right?",
    "So our mind makes this\nanswer despite that.\nAnd that's what we think\nwe might know.",
    "we might know.\nNow, we might not be\ntotally certain.\nWe might not bet the\nfarm on that.",
    "farm on that.\nWhich is farther north--\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania,\nor Rome, Italy?",
    "So start to think-- how would\nyou think about that?\nIt's not something you know.",
    "Nobody memorizes it, right?\nBut how would you begin\nto think which is\nprobably more northern?",
    "What's your first gut?\nHow many people like\nPhiladelphia being more north?",
    "How many people like Rome\nbeing more north?\nThere's kind of a mixture\nof hands.",
    "of hands.\nThe answer is that Rome is\nnorth of Philadelphia.\nMostly people will answer that",
    "Philadelphia is north.\nWhy they do that is they think\nthe US and Europe, they're",
    "both sort of above the equator,\nbelow Antarctica,\nkind of a aligned, even\nhistorically, culturally.",
    "So they think, well, Rome is\npretty south in Europe.\nAnd it is.\nIt's in Italy.",
    "It's in Italy.\nPhiladelphia's reasonably\nnorth in the US.\nIt gets winters and all",
    "that kinds of stuff.\nSo a northern city in the US\nhas got to be north of a\nsouthern city in Europe.",
    "But in fact, Europe is-- the\nwhole continent is shifted up\ncompared to the US.",
    "So you won't-- wait until get\nyour mind around this.\nWhich is further north,\nAtlanta or Chicago?",
    "[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: All right,\nall right.\nSorry.\nIt's sort of a joke.",
    "Because sometimes when you do\nthis, people go like, wait a\nminute, all my assumptions\nare off.",
    "are off.\nLike, where am I?\nWhat's reality?\n[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: OK.\nHere's one more-- two more.",
    "Which is further north,\nPortland or Toronto?\nNow you are already learning\nthe lesson go opposite.",
    "Whatever I thought, go\nopposite, right?\nBut why do you think most\npeople will answer that",
    "Toronto is further north?\nCanada is up there, US is\nbelow it, but in fact--\nthat's the mental map",
    "in the colors.\nBut in fact, Portland\nin Oregon is\nactually north of Toronto.\nWe'll do one last one.",
    "Which is further west?\nWhich is further west, Miami,\nFlorida-- which that's all the",
    "way towards the Atlantic\nOcean--\nor Santiago, Chili-- which is\ntowards the Pacific Ocean.",
    "Further west.\nSo most people have a mental\nmap that North America and\nSouth America are kind of",
    "lined up like that.\nAnd so you say well, Miami is\nfurther east and Santiago's\nfarther west.",
    "farther west.\nBut in fact, South America is\nfairly shifted compared to\nNorth America.",
    "North America.\nAnd Santiago is actually more\neastern or Miami is more\nwestern, one relative",
    "to the other.\nBecause in our head, we kind\nof think, North and South",
    "America-- they're kind of lined\nup even though we never\nsaw a global map like that.",
    "So again, some of our knowledge\nguides how we think\nabout the world and what\nwe believe we know.",
    "So what's the point of this?\nIt's what used to be called\ntelephone, right?",
    "Their story keeps changing.\nAnd it's hard to remember\ndetails in a story.",
    "People remember a nugget, or\nwhat we call a gist in\npsychology, a little point.",
    "And second, what you take as a\npoint is how you then tell the\nnext person, the way you",
    "interpret the story,\nsomething like that.\nThanks very much,\nthat was good.\n[APPLAUSE]",
    "[APPLAUSE]\nPROFESSOR: Again, two things--\nour memory for precise details\nis surprisingly modest.",
    "And how we interpret things\nmatter changes things a lot.\nSo now, you had four brave",
    "students demonstrating some of\nthe limits and properties\nof memory.\nSo now, here's an exercise you",
    "can do in your own seat.\nOK, you're just knowing\nyourself how you\ndid, but here we go.",
    "I'm going to read\nyou some words.\nAnd then just give you-- don't\nhave to write anything down.",
    "If you write it down,\nit's no good.\nAnd then I'm going to ask you on\na recognition test, whether",
    "you heard a word or not.\nReady?\nSo here's the list.\nSo just listen and then\nI'll test your memory",
    "for it right after.\nHere's the list.\nSour, candy, sugar, bitter,\ngood, taste, tooth, nice,",
    "honey, soda, chocolate, heart,\ncake, tart, pie.\nOK?\nAll right, how many\npeople heard the",
    "word \"sour?\" All right.\nYeah, excellent, thank you.\n\"Chair.\" \"Candy.\" Hey.",
    "\"Honey.\" \"Building.\" \"Sweet.\"\nEvery hand up there, you have\na false memory.\n[LAUGHTER]",
    "[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: Now, it's\na set up OK?\nBecause here's the way they make",
    "these lists, it's a set\nup, but there's a huge lesson.\nAnd in fact, you may hear",
    "debates about what are real\nmemories, what are false\nmemories, in court cases, in\nclinical cases.",
    "This is a laboratory experiment\nthat's been the\ntesting ground for lots of ideas",
    "about how we make real\nmemories and how we end up\nwith false memories.\nSo here's the way they",
    "made the list.\nThey took the word \"sour.\" And\nthey took a lot of students",
    "basically like you and said,\nwhat's the first word you\nthink of that goes with sour?",
    "And people came up with\nthis kind of a list.\nCandy, sugar, bitter, good,\ntaste, tooth, nice, honey,",
    "soda, chocolate, heart,\ncake, tart, pie.\nBut they left out one\nword that people\ncame up with a lot.",
    "The word \"sweet.\" OK?\nSo your mind interpreted\nthe list.\nYou said, hey, this is all about",
    "things that are related\nto sweet things in one way or\nanother-- sweet sugar, sweet",
    "candy, sweet and sour, honey is\nsweet, chocolate is sweet.\nSo your mind imagined it heard",
    "the word \"sweet.\" And the\nmajority of you put your hand up\nthat you actually heard the",
    "word \"sweet.\" Your mind imagined\nit was there because\nthat was generally what\nwas going on.",
    "was going on.\nThat was the gist of\nthe experience, OK?\nSo this idea is it's very",
    "easy, because of the way\nmemory works, we remember the\ngist of things because that's",
    "what's the important part.\nIt's hard to remember\nthe details.\nBut that gist is an\ninterpreted gist.",
    "The gist was it's\nsweet things.\nSo the word \"sweet\" feels like\nit was part of the memory.",
    "And we'll come back to that\nlater on in the course.\nSo one of the themes we'll talk",
    "about a lot in the course\nis both an amazing power of the\nhuman mind and an amazing",
    "peril of the human mind.\nAnd it's what psychologists\ncall automaticity.",
    "It's that our mind, in order\nto be efficient and quick,\ndoes things automatically",
    "without thought, without\nconsciousness.\nIt lets us walk without\nthinking a lot about",
    "where our feet are.\nIt lets us speak quickly without\nthinking about the\nsyntax and the vocabulary,",
    "right?\nIt lets us do a lot of things.\nSo that's the power of it.\nThe peril is when something",
    "becomes automatic, we lose\ncontrol of it within\nourselves.\nSo I need somebody at their",
    "seat who's willing to read\naloud something as fast as they\ncan when they see it on",
    "the computer monitor.\nIf I can get a volunteer\nat your seat.\nOK, all the way back\nthere, OK.",
    "there, OK.\nAnd then I'll come to you\nfor the second one.\nReady?\nHere it comes.",
    "Here it comes.\nAs fast as you can, go.\nAUDIENCE: One way\nnot do enter.\nPROFESSOR: OK, then,",
    "you got it.\nI couldn't trick you.\nOK.\nBut you might imagine a person\nmight mistake that, right?",
    "Was there another one?\nWas it you?\nOK, ready?\nHere we go.\nGo.\nAUDIENCE: Paris in spring.",
    "PROFESSOR: Ah.\nI got you on that.\n[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: Because your mind\nis automatically reading.",
    "We have lots of evidence in\npsychology that you're barely\nlooking at words like\n\"the.\" You're",
    "\"the.\" You're\nassuming over those things.\nThey're almost invisible to you\nthere even though they're",
    "physically present, because your\nmind is looking for the\nbig content, right?",
    "Who cares about the word \"the?\"\nYour mind is going for\nthe essential information, and",
    "it becomes literally blind to\nwhat's in front of you, because\nit knows what it's\nlooking for.",
    "looking for.\nHere's a fun one.\nYou've seen things like\nthis before, but it's\nalways fun to try.",
    "It's the same principle.\nHow many letter F's do you\nfind in this display?\nCan I get some numbers?",
    "AUDIENCE: 6.\nAUDIENCE: 4.\nAUDIENCE: 5.\nPROFESSOR: 4, 5, 6.\nThose are all good.",
    "We're not an exact science.\n[CLAMORING]\nPROFESSOR: Some of you may have\nmissed one or two F's.",
    "Again, it's because your\nmind is automatically--\ntypical readers read at\nspectacular speeds.",
    "And the way you read at a\nspectacular speed is you don't\nlook for little details.",
    "You get the big words and the\nbig ideas and you zoom through\nfor the big meaning.",
    "And you're leaving behind what\nyou consider to be details.\nYeah.\nAUDIENCE: So if you ask this",
    "question to a society that\npronounces \"of\" just\nlike \"off,\"\nwould that change anything?",
    "PROFESSOR: The question was if\nwe asked a society that didn't\npronounce F's or something\nlike that.",
    "like that.\nAUDIENCE: That didn't pronounce\nF's as F's.\nIn America, we pronounce\nit \"of.\"",
    "it \"of.\"\nPROFESSOR: \"Of,\" you mean\nlike a \"v\" sound or\nsomething like that.",
    "Does that matter for this?\nYes.\nIt also matters a lot that words\nlike \"of\" are little",
    "preposition words that we\ndon't think much about.\nSo this is a set up.\nLike \"finish,\" most",
    "people get.\nOr the beginning of a word\nyou're more likely to get.\nI think the pronunciation",
    "probably matters.\nI don't know that for sure.\nThat's a very good thought.",
    "And certainly, hiding it in\nwords that seem low in content\nfor interpreting a sentence is",
    "about the best way we did it.\nThat's why the second \"the\"\ndisappeared too.\nIt's sort of a low",
    "content word for\nprocessing a sentence.\nOK.\nThis is an example that you",
    "know, but it's a nice example\nand we can come back to\nit a couple times.\nSo let me think about",
    "this for one second.\nMaybe we'll do it this way--\nthat we'll ask somebody at",
    "their seat who has typical\ncolor vision.\nIf you're color blind, this one\nis not a good one for you.",
    "Some percentage are.\nIs somebody willing at their\nseat to read aloud stuff they\nsee on a monitor?",
    "OK, thank you.\nHere we go.\nSo you're gonna see words\nthat are printed\nin different colors.",
    "Your job is to name aloud the\ncolor of the ink that it's\nprinted in.\nDoes that make sense?",
    "So like on this F, you\nwould say it's red on\nthat F. Is that OK?\nHere we go.",
    "Here we go.\nSo start here and just go.\nAUDIENCE: Red, orange.\nPROFESSOR: As fast as you",
    "can, just keep going.\nAUDIENCE: Green, brown, pink,\ngreen, blue, yellow, red.",
    "PROFESSOR: Great, excellent.\nSame thing.\nRead the color of the ink\nexactly like you were doing.\nGo.",
    "Go.\nAUDIENCE: Green, blue, red,\nblue, red, yellow, red.\nPROFESSOR: Ah, you're\npretty good.\nOK.",
    "OK.\nIt's supposed to slow you down\nwhen you get the ink in the\nwrong colors.\nAnd it usually does.",
    "But you were very good.\nAll right.\nAgain, if you know this from\ncourses and the internet,",
    "don't ruin it for others, but\nthink about it for yourself.\nSo now we're gonna\nturn to thought.",
    "There's 30 people in a room.\nJust imagine you sat-- there'\njust groups of 30 here.",
    "You get the month and date of\neach person's birthday.\nSo it's not the year they were",
    "born, but it could be December\n1 or February 5 or something\nlike that.\nWhat is the approximate",
    "probability that two people\nwill have the exact\nsame birthday?\nI can tell you the vast majority",
    "of people under\nslightly less suspicious\ncircumstances of this will\nanswer about 10%.",
    "That's the vast majority.\nThe correct answer is--\nOK?\nWhy do you think--\nthis is work from Kahneman",
    "and Tversky.\nWe'll come back to this.\nWhy do you think people tend\nto answer 10%, some 30%?",
    "Very few people give you\nthe mathematically\ncorrect answer of 70%.\nWhy do they do that?",
    "Because they tend to think, how\noften have I met somebody\nwho has my exact birthday?",
    "And you go, not that often.\nIt's not like every 30 people\nI meet, somebody says, you",
    "were born on March 3.\nI was born in March 3.\nAnd then you go have lunch\nand you go, hey, I was",
    "born on March 3.\nAnd you go have dinner with\nanother group and they go, I\nwas born on March 3.",
    "It's not something that\nhappens a lot, right?\nSo you go, well, in real\nlife it doesn't seem",
    "to happen very often.\nThat's what we call a\nheuristic-- a simple way to\nthink about it.",
    "Because your experience\nis kind of like that.\nBut why is that incorrect",
    "mathematically for this question?\nBecause the math depends on\nnot that's exactly your",
    "birthday, but any pair of\nbirthdays among the 30 people.\nAnd then it goes way up.",
    "In fact, it goes to 70%.\nAnd if it's 24 people,\nit's 50%.\nIf you're a group of 36 people,",
    "there's a 90% chance,\njust mathematically, that\ntwo people will\nshare the same birthday.",
    "Because when we face things that\nare hard to think about,\nbecause there's no easy answer,",
    "humans tend to take\nshortcuts and say, what's the\ngist of my experience, and\nthat's what I think",
    "the answer is.\nEven when a calculable\nanswer is available.\nIt's human nature to make a",
    "shortcut based on your sense\nof your experience.\nSo there's a very interesting\nline of work--",
    "line of work--\nDan Gilbert of Harvard\nis a leading figure--\nabout this idea of thinking",
    "about your future.\nNow, thinking about our future\nis a big thing, right?",
    "We're thinking about what's it\nlike in this course, what's it\nlike in college, what's our",
    "friendship like, relations\nwith parents, what's our future\ncareer paths, what kind",
    "of life will we lead, right?\nOur future is something that's\nhugely on our mind, I think,",
    "very powerfully when you're\na college student\nor a graduate student.\nWhat's my future?",
    "And a big question that people\nhave is what will make me\nhappy in a deep sense?",
    "What will make me happy\nin a deep sense?\nBecause that's the life\nI want to lead--",
    "the values I want to have, the\nkind of career choices and\npersonal choices I want to make,",
    "where I will devote my\ntime on this earth.\nSo most people, first of all,\ntend to think about good",
    "things, positive things.\nActually, I can tell you what\ncomes later in the course.",
    "It's good to think that lots of\npositive things are happening.\nIt's kind of a nice place",
    "to be in terms of\nbeing a happy person.\nBut it turns out that people\nhave done studies like this.",
    "So now this is particularly\nsensitive for a faculty\nmember, but it could work for",
    "any sports team you've tried\nout or anything you've tried\nout for in your life.",
    "So what happens when we get\nreviewed for tenure?\nAnd you hear a bit about that.",
    "This was an easy study for\na psychologist to do.\nWhat they did is they called up",
    "people in the fall who were\nbeing reviewed for tenure.\nAnd you get tenure\nor you don't.",
    "or you don't.\nAnd it's a bit of a sad process\nif you don't, right,\nbecause you don't get tenure,",
    "and then you don't feel happy\nabout that.\nAnd you have to call your\nparents and say, I didn't get",
    "tenure, and your parents go,\ncome on, if you just slept\nbetter, you would've\ngotten tenure.",
    "gotten tenure.\n[LAUGHTER]\nPROFESSOR: Remember the piano\nlessons you didn't take.\nSo it's a bit of a",
    "nuisance, right?\nOn top of that--\nbecause weirdly, in academics,\nwe tend to be super",
    "specialized-- you have\nto move out of town.\nYou don't have to, but\ntypically, a person who",
    "doesn't get tenure will get\na job somewhere else.\nThere's plenty of stories of",
    "people who don't get tenure at\nawesome places who were\ngeniuses in history.\nThe tenure decisions",
    "are often wrong.\nBut still, you'd rather\nget it than not.\nYou'd rather get into the",
    "medical school than not.\nYou'd rather make a sports\nteam you want\nto be on than not.",
    "So here's what they found out.\nIf they asked them what happens\nif you don't get",
    "tenure, everybody says, oh,\nit's gonna be awful.\nIt's gonna be miserable.\nI'm gonna be such an",
    "unhappy person.\nTwo years later, the average\nhappiness of people who didn't",
    "get tenure was equal to the\naverage happiness of people\nwho did get tenure.\nSo you can say, well,",
    "tenure-- only\nprofessors care about tenure.\nWell, how about winning\nthe lottery?",
    "the lottery?\nWhat if I won hundreds of\nthousands of dollars?\nThere' been a lot of psychology",
    "on this, actually.\nIn about a year to two, the\naverage happiness of a lottery",
    "winner who won a substantial\namount of money is rated the\nsame by him or her as it was",
    "the population as a whole.\nYeah?\nAUDIENCE: How did they go about\nmeasuring average happiness?",
    "PROFESSOR: Yeah, so we'll\ncome back to this,\nbut I'll tell you.\nYou can like this or\nnot like this.",
    "not like this.\nIn some parts of psychology,\nwe measure things like\nreaction time to the",
    "millisecond.\nThat's good data, right?\nOur brain activation,\nthat's good data.",
    "When you ask a person how happy\nthey are, the only thing\nwe can do is have you basically",
    "fill a scale from\none to seven.\nHow happy are you?\nAnd you could go, well I'm a",
    "little worried about that,\nbecause sometimes people say, I\nhope that it makes you happy",
    "or something.\nSo you could say, how\nmuch can we trust\nsubjective reports of happiness?",
    "And that's a very\ngood question.\nOn the other hand, it's hard\nto know what would",
    "be better than that.\nIf we measure your\npulse, is that a\nbetter measure of happiness?",
    "Your pulse could be racing\nbecause you're sad or happy,\nscared or enthusiastic.",
    "So we don't have a better one\nthat we can think of.\nBut psychologists do worry that",
    "sometimes people will\njust say what they're\nsupposed to say.\nOr they'll pretend they're happy",
    "or things like that.\nWe have to worry about\nthose things.\nSo you could worry deep down,",
    "but a year or two later,\npeople who win huge amounts of\nmoney don't report themselves",
    "as any happier than people\naround them.\nAnd kind of amazingly--\nbut I think it's deep\nabout life--",
    "about life--\naccidents leading to\nquadriplegia or paraplegia,\naccidents that, before you had",
    "such an accident you would\nimagine that it would be\nsomething extremely difficult.",
    "And it can be in many ways.\nBut by self report, ratings of\nhappiness return to typical",
    "average populations\nof the same age\nin about three months.\nSo what's a huge lesson here",
    "in happiness research--\na huge surprise.\nIt's two things.\nWe're kind of bad at predicting",
    "what will make us\nhappy or sad, which is\nkind of weird, right?\nWe're kind of bad at\npredicting it.",
    "predicting it.\nHere's all these things where\nwe think they would make us",
    "happy or make us not so happy.\nIt turns out we're wrong when\nthis is studied at all\nscientifically.",
    "So we'll come back to that later\non, because it's a very\ndeep thing about\nbeing a human--",
    "what makes you happy and\nyour wrong guesses\nsometimes about what does.\nSo let me end with a",
    "last experiment.\nSo we've really haven't done\nexperiments until right now.",
    "And this is now a sensitive and\ndifficult issue, which is\nproblems we have in dealing\nwith racism.",
    "with racism.\nAnd here's a study that\ndid the following.\nIt said, well, in North America,",
    "certainly, Canada,\nthe US-- a study was\ndone in Canada--\nracism is widely condemned,",
    "as I think most of us\nbelieve it should be.\nBut examples of blatant\nracism still occurred.",
    "One recent poll said that\nabout a third of white\nindividuals reported hearing",
    "anti-black slurs in the\nworkplace in the last\ncouple years--\nto pick one thing.",
    "So how does this happen in a\nsociety that speaks so much\nabout not being racist, about",
    "treating everybody equally and\nfairly and kindly?\nHow does it happen that\nwe still struggle.",
    "And it's such a very deep,\ndifficult question about human\nnature and the world\nwe live in.",
    "we live in.\nBut here's something again\nthat's a hint about why it's\nhard to get society to change",
    "some of its behaviors.\nSo here's the experiment--\nso it's an actual experiment.",
    "So they took two groups of\ncollege undergraduates and\nrandomly assigned one to be",
    "in the forecaster group.\nThat's a group that tells you\nhow they think they would feel",
    "and how they think they would\nact under certain\ncircumstances.\nAnd then an experiencer\ngroup--",
    "group--\nthat's a group who actually\nundergoes an experience, and\nI'll tell you what\nthat is now.",
    "that is now.\nSo in the experiencer group,\npretend you were their\nresearch participant.",
    "You walk into a room, and you\nsee in that room a black male\nand a white male.",
    "Now those two are what\npsychologists, for some\nreason, have called\nconfederates.",
    "confederates.\nThose are role players.\nThey know what they're doing.\nThey have a plan of what",
    "they're going to do.\nThey're going to put on\na little show for you.\nBut you don't know that.",
    "And the black male stands up and\nleaves the room to get his\ncell phone, and he gently bumps",
    "the white male's knee.\nThis is all set up.\nYou're just sitting there and\nyou see that little bump.",
    "And now, there's three\ndifferent groups.\nOne group, that's it.\nNothing else happens--",
    "A small bump, and the\nperson leaves.\nA second group--\nas you sit there, the black",
    "individual leaves the room and\nthe white individual says,\nquote, \"Typical, I hate it",
    "when black people do that.\"\nIt's meant to be obviously\nprovocative and racist.",
    "And then what they consider\nan extreme slur--\nthe white person in the room",
    "playing this role uses the\nderogatory word that's meant\nto be an extreme slur.",
    "So there's one more thing\nyou need to know.\nNow, you're sitting there, and",
    "you're either in the control\ngroup where there's been the\nslight bump, or there's been a",
    "moderate slur, or an extreme\nslur in their words.\nThe black male returns.",
    "Don't forget, he's in on it,\nand so is that white male.\nBut you're not in on it.",
    "You just think there was a bump,\nand something else may\nhave happened, depending on",
    "which condition you're in.\nAnd the experimenter then gives\nyou a survey about how",
    "you feel right now.\nSort of like the happiness,\nbut it's not that.\nIt's like, how do you",
    "feel right now?\nAnd then asks you to pick\nbetween those two people a\npartner for an anagram",
    "experiment that\nyou're about to do.\nSo they're going to ask you--\nthis is sort of this",
    "question you have.\nWhat's the difference or\nsimilarity between what you\nsay you're feeling is and",
    "what you really do?\nBoth things are important,\nbut do they line up, do\nthey not line up?",
    "So here's the results.\nHere's a graph.\nAnd here's how this works.\nNegative emotional distress the",
    "higher the bar, the more\nyou say, I feel really bad about\nwhat's just happened.",
    "I just heard this comment\nor no comment.\nSo let's take a look,\nthe higher the bar.",
    "If you heard no comment,\nhere's how you begin.\nSo let's start with\nthe forecasters.",
    "All of you are forecasters,\nbecause you're pretending\nyou're in the situation\nbut you're not in it.",
    "So here is there was\nno comments.\nThat's sort of average\nor something.\nAnd then you said if you",
    "heard a racial slur\nyou would feel terrible.\nYou would feel terrible.",
    "But look at the other students\nwho are randomly picked.\nSo we don't think it's a",
    "difference among students.\nLook at these grey bars.\nThey're pretty flat.\nThe person on the spot is",
    "somehow not processing this.\nAnd they're filling out,\nI feel average.\nYou see the split--",
    "the split between the values\nthat the person thinks they\nwould have, and the values that",
    "are responded to on the\nspot in the moment.\nAnd what we'll talk about later\non in social psychology",
    "is there's a tough gap, often,\nbetween the values we espouse\nand how we act when there's",
    "especially unexpected,\ndifficult things.\nAnd very often--\nif you've had any experience",
    "like this-- afterwards, you\ngo, oh, what I should\nhave done is this.\nOr I wish I would've",
    "said that.\nBut that moment is not happening\nat that moment,\nprobably because you're",
    "kind of weirded out\nby the whole thing.\nWhat's going on?\nWhy would the person say this?",
    "Something doesn't seem right.\nI can't sort it out.\nAnd so people tend to shrink",
    "in terms of making a strong\nconclusion of what's going on\nif something seems unusually\nprovocative.",
    "provocative.\nAnd you could say, well, OK,\nthat's their attitudes.\nBut how about their action?",
    "Who do they pick to\nbe their partner?\nAnd again, the people\nforecasting said, if I was in",
    "this situation, I would never\npick that racist white person\nto be my partner, because",
    "that person stinks--\nif I was in that situation.\nBut if the people are\nin the situation--",
    "look at the grey bars--\npretty flat.\nIt's a if on the spot, in the\nmoment, they can't quite",
    "process the values they\nfeel and the action\nthey're going to take.\nAnd we'll talk about that.",
    "And it's very hard, often,\nin part, to be brave\nand stand up to things.\nIt turns out there's a lot",
    "of evidence for this.\nIt's a human nature thing.\nIt's very hard to be brave and",
    "stand up to things when things\nare kind of weird, because\nalmost everybody at first",
    "thinks, I don't want to\nmake a fool of myself.\nI don't want make trouble.\nMaybe I'm not getting the",
    "whole picture on this.\nAnd we shrink back from acting\nin a way that aligns with the",
    "values that are clearly\nshown here.\nSo this, again, is something\nabout human",
    "about human\nnature that's very weird.\nAnd it's powerful to come\ninto social psychology.",
    "And that's why it's very hard\nto stand up to things like\noppression and bias.",
    "It's very hard to do, because\nwe tend to not act on our\nvalues when we're\nin complicated",
    "in complicated\nsituations on the spot.\nAnd there's a tremendous amount\nof evidence for that.",
    "So again, how we interpret\nthe situation--\nvery different in our mind when\nwe imagine we're there,",
    "and when we actually\nsit there.\nAnd so what these researchers\nsay is this is partly why it's",
    "been hard to eradicate some\nvestiges of stereotypes and\nracism, because people have a",
    "hard time clamping down on it\nin the moment.\nSo that's a tough topic, but we",
    "know we want to deal both\nwith things that are less\ncontroversial but also things",
    "that touch people's lives\nin the real world\nthat we live in.\nSo we talked about a\nscientific study",
    "of the human nature--\nmind and behavior--\nhow what we see and hear is",
    "determined so much but how our\nmind interprets the world around\nus; how we remember",
    "things like word lists or\nstories, that's hugely\ninfluenced by what we expect to",
    "see, like in the picture;\nhow we think we know things like\nwhere Reno is compared to",
    "San Francisco; how we think\nabout things like the\nprobability that somebody else",
